The senior vice president project sponsor is insistent that the new trading
system must support five nines of availability (9.999%). However, the lead
architect is convinced, based on research, calculations, and knowledge of

the business domain and technology, that three nines of availability (99.9%)
would be sufficient. The problem is, the project sponsor does not like to be
wrong or corrected and really hates people who are condescending. The
sponsor isn't overly technical (but thinks they are) and as a result tends to
getinvolved in the nonfunctional aspects of projects. The architect must
convince the project sponsor through negotiation that three nines (99.9%) of
availability would be enough.
