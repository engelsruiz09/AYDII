The lead architect on a project believes that asynchronous messaging would be the right
approach for communication between a group of services to increase both performance
and scalability. However, the other architect on the project once again strongly disagrees
and insists that REST would be a better choice, because REST is always faster than
messaging and can scale just as well (“see for yourself by Googling it!”). This is not the
first heated debate between the two architects, nor will it be the last. The lead architect
must convince the other architect that messaging is the right solution.
